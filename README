ImageZ is very much work-in-progress multi-layer bitmap image editor.

'main claim to fame': It allows layers to be created in different
formats - from 8-bit RGB to float RGBA, internally all blending
operations operate using floating point.

I'm also experimenting with some novel GUI ideas - hidden menus,
internal dialog boxes, and attempting to reduce or eliminate
'popup-pox'.

It represents about 2 months of full-time effort, although many
problems are not yet addressed or incomplete.

Features
--------

These things are already implemented to some level of functionality,
but also see Status and the TODO file.

o compound selections
-> rectangle or ellipse
-> boolean operators and/or/not
-> invert selection
-> editing of last object added
-> feathering
-> anti-aliasing

o cut/copy/paste of layer content
-> uses system clipboard
-> able to create a new image from the clipboard

o affine operations on layers
-> using a single tool for scale/rotate/shear

o load of image formats supported by Java2D
-> nice load dialog with preview and meta-data view

o save of png, jpeg images.
-> supports jpeg+alpha (non-standard use of 4-channel jpeg)
-> supports png 16 or 8 bit
-> nice save dialogues
-> images automatically flattened, alpha optional
-> able to save comments in both formats.
-> unlimited number of images open at once.

o editable brush types
-> fill
-> shape
-> size

o infinite undo/redo
-> limited only by memory size
-> uses compacted 'sparse layer' to store layer edits

o zoom
-> 15 preset sizes

o image operations
-> resize image

o layer operations
-> add/remove layer
-> reorder layers
-> resize layer
-> explicit alpha channel in layer type
-> per layer opacity and blending mode

o multiple layer types, independent of image
-> RGB, RGBA, Greyscale, Greyscale + alpha
-> 8 bit unsigned
-> 16 bit unsigned
-> 32-bit float

o 'amiga' menus
-> menu is hidden until you press the menu button (right mouse button)

o single-window-per-image interface
-> state is per-image
-> fixed-panel for most tools
-> internal frames for some other tools, controlled by function keys

o screenshot capability
-> able to select individual window on linux

o effects on layers
-> gaussian blur
-> brightness/contrast
-> wiener deconvolution (uses fft - broken at the moment)

o utilises multiple cores if available
-> for effects
-> for blending (i.e. every edit/update)
-> significant performance benefits on modern hardware

Status
------

Alpha, or pre-alpha.  Many features are missing or not working
properly despite the lengthy list above.

See the TODO file for a list of minimum features required before the
application reaches beta level.  The main one is the lack of ability
to save multi-layer images as layers!

The blending engine is fairly solid, as is the undo system and
selection mechanism.  I'm still working on the tool design.  I'm
reasonably happy with some ui features such as the saving dialogues,
hidden menus, and over-all single-window layout.  Others need work or
making more consistent.

Performance is reasonable - it uses all threads on the host system
to perform blending, so it runs even better on multi-cpu boxes.
