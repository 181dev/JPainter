Minimum level of features required before I would consider this beta quality:

- Save/load float or 32-bit images.
- Fix all the blend modes - only normal is implemented.
 (the alpha model changed, which broke the blend modes)
- Fix super-affine tool - it's nearly there now.
- More work on the draw tool.  e.g. opaciy and so on.
- Change the way brushes are set.  Right now you basically edit the
  brush on the fly, but this sucks.  Need a brush list separated from
  a brush editor.  And separated from brush parameters like
  colour/opacity/etc.
- Fix paste, ability to paste into layer, move it around.
- More layer ops, e.g. merge down
- Fix affine layer editing - rotations might crop the image.
- Weiner deconvolution is broken. (only seems to work for ^2 sized images?)
- Effects GUI inconsistent
- Other GUI inconsistencies in various dialog boxes.
- Ability to resize the image independently of layer size(s)
- Change layer type.
- Change zoom without resetting view
- Save jpeg comments
- Remember comments/other meta-data set on file when loaded.

Other todo:

- Implement brush editor/brush selector.
- Fix the colour selector.
- (re)implement some basic effects.
- half-float image types - although I can't see how these can be
  implemented efficiently.
- Store undo information to disk (persitently?)
